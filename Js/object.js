// -->> Object declaration -->>

// student ={name:"Superleggera" , age:25, hometown:"Dhaka"}; 

// --> how to print objects -->>

// student["age"]; Same as arrays in one way, will have to call the property name inside the bracket, then it will print the value.

// student.age -> this will print the value of the object propert which is called after the dot.

// student["Occupation"] = "student"; -> this will insert a new property and value to the object.

// student.city = "Tangail"; -> this will also insert a new property and value to the object.

// delete student.city; -> this will delete the property from the object and return a boolean value to the console

// student = {}; ->> this will print/add an empty object
